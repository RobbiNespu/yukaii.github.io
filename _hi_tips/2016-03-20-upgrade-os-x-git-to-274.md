Due to the [CVE-2016-2324, CVE-2016â€‘2315](https://ma.ttias.be/remote-code-execution-git-versions-client-server-2-7-1-cve-2016-2324-cve-2016-2315/), we should upgrade our git client immediatly to prevent remote code execution :p.

In OS X, git comes with XCode Developer tool, but if we want to use the lastest git, it can be installed through Homebrew.

```bash
brew install git
which git # check git path
```

For second command, you may find that the path still in /usr/bin/git.

Edit your shell configuration file(`~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` or even `~/.zshrc`) to place `/usr/local/bin/git` before `/usr/bin`

For example

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin/git:$PATH"
```

start a new shell check git version by

```bash
git --version
```

Also remember to set SourceTree git to System provided.
